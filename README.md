# AWS Deployment Project Collections

A comprehensive collection of AWS serverless applications and deployment examples, showcasing various AWS services, architectures, and deployment patterns.

## üéØ Overview

This repository contains multiple AWS-based projects demonstrating different serverless architectures, services, and deployment strategies. Each project is designed to showcase specific AWS capabilities and can serve as learning examples or starter templates for your own AWS deployments.

## üìÇ Projects

## üöÄ Getting Started

Each project contains its own detailed README with specific setup instructions. Generally, you'll need:

### Prerequisites

- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- AWS CLI installed and configured
- Node.js (version specified in each project)
- Serverless Framework (`npm install -g serverless`)

### General Setup Steps

1. Navigate to the desired project directory
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure AWS credentials: `aws configure`
4. Deploy: `npm run deploy` or `serverless deploy`

## üõ†Ô∏è AWS Services Covered

This collection demonstrates the following AWS services:
